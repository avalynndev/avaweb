# avaweb

My personal corner of the internet. A portfolio site built to showcase my work, share my projects, and connect with others.

## What's This?

This is my personal website where I share what I'm working on, write about things I find interesting, and make it easy for people to get in touch. It's simple, fast, and built the way I like it.

## What You'll Find

- **Portfolio**: Projects I've built and shipped
- **About**: Who I am and what I do
- **Contact**: Ways to reach me

## Running It Locally

If you want to run this on your machine for some reason:
```bash
bun i
bun run dev
```

Then head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Built With

- **Next.js 16** - The framework that just works
- **TypeScript** - Because I like my code typed
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling without the headache
- **Shadcn UI** - Clean components that look good
- **next-themes** - Dark mode support (obviously)

## Structure

Pretty straightforward:

- `app/` - Pages and routes
- `components/` - Reusable UI pieces
- `lib/` - Helper functions and utilities

---

Built by me, for me. But feel free to look around.
